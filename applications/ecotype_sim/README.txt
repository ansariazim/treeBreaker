I tried to use the the data set published in the following paper by Cohan:
"Ecology of speciation in the genus Bacillus."

In that paper they say that they remove the genes that have recombined and then use maximum parsimony to make a tree and then pass it on to the
ES and Adaptml. However, I just used the sequences as they are and used raxml to infer the maximum likelihood tree. I then passed this tree to treeBreaker.
This has lead to some really long branches which are likely due to recombination.
